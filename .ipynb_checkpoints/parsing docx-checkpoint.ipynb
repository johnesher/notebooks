      "Tonometry is the procedure eye care professionals perform to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP), the fluid pressure inside the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The TonoPuff is a Class IIa hand held medical device with initial production volumes of 750 for the first year and 1200 per year after that. This is a non-contact tonometer where a rapid air pulse is used to applanate the cornea. Corneal applanation is detected via an electro-optical system. IOP is then estimated by detecting the force of the air jet at the instant of applanation.\n",
